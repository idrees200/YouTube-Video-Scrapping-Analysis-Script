# YouTube Video Analysis Script

## Overview

This script gathers data from a YouTube channel and conducts comprehensive analysis on video uploads, including metrics like views, likes, comments, and upload dates.

## Steps and Features

1. **Web Scraping Setup**:
   - Utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the YouTube channel page.
   - Selenium interacts with the page dynamically (scrolling, clicking), while BeautifulSoup parses HTML content for specific data.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieves video titles, views, upload times, comments, likes, and video links from the channel page.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Converts relative time (e.g., "3 days ago") to actual date format for analysis.
   - Extracts and cleans numerical data (views, likes) from their respective elements.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculates statistics like correlation between likes and comments.
   - Identifies outliers in views data using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
   - Computes views-to-likes ratio to pinpoint videos with high engagement relative to views.

5. **Visualization and Insights**:
   - Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
   - Identifies trends such as the most common day of the week for video uploads.

6. **Output**:
   - Saves collected data into a CSV file (`21_L5632youassign1.csv`) for further analysis or reporting.

## Dependencies

- Python libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- ChromeDriver (ensure compatibility with your Chrome browser version)

## Usage

- Replace `URL` variable with the target YouTube channel URL.
- Execute the script to gather and analyze data from the channel.
- Customize parameters and methods as per specific analysis requirements.
